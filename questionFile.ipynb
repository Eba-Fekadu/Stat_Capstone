    "🎓 Capstone Group Project: E-Commerce Sales Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Overview\n",
    "This capstone project serves as the culmination of your learning journey in Statistics for Data Analytics. You will apply the complete range of statistical and analytical techniques covered in this course to a real-world e-commerce dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to replicate the end-to-end workflow of a professional data analyst:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean and prepare messy business data.\n",
    "Apply descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.\n",
    "Build predictive models using regression and time-series methods.\n",
    "Derive meaningful business insights and recommendations.\n",
    "You will complete the project using Python and submit your work via Git/GitHub. At the end, you will not only demonstrate mastery of statistical concepts but also showcase your skills in reproducible analytics and professional reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset (please find the dataset named “synthetic_retail_data.csv” from the portal) contains approximately 9,500 e-commerce transactions recorded during 2023. Each record represents a customer purchase and includes details on products, pricing, discounts, customer demographics, marketing channels, and purchasing behavior.\n",
